                <p class="Introtxt">Welcome to CursorBridge, a place where you can find all the UI you need for your website. CursorBridge is for people who are not very good at making UI or are just very new to website development (if you are new then welcome!). CursorBridge has easy to read and change code, meaning that you can change the background or the text or any part of the code to your likings. CursorBridge is also for people who just want to put some nice looking UI in their website to make it look more attractive and interesting. In this documentation, we are going to go over how you can implement these designs in your website to make them look more professional.</p>

                <h1 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">What are SVGs?</h1>
                    <p class="Introtxt">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional based vector graphics. ... SVG is, essentially, to graphics what HTML is to text. SVG images and their related behaviors are defined in XML text files, which means they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. One of the pros of SVG is that the quality is not lost. Meaning, unlike images, you can make the picture as big as you want but it will not loose its image quality. One of the downside is that SVG cannot make images look realistic and thus have to like more or less cartoony. However, all of the component designs are 2d, thus the code  in CursorBridge is optimized for SVG.</p>
