CursorBridge is for people who are not very good at making UI or are just very new to website development (if you are new then welcome!). CursorBridge has easy to read and change code, meaning that you can change the background or the text or any part of the code to your likings. CursorBridge is also for people who just want to put some nice looking UI in their website to make it look more attractive and interesting. In this documentation, we are going to go over how you can implement these designs in your website to make them look more professional.</p>
